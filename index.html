Basic command line commands
===========================

1> ls: This command is used to check the contents of the folder

2> pwd
pwd stands for "print working directory". It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.

2> cd:
cd stands for "change directory". This command is used to change from one directory to another directory.
Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, cd switches you into the directory you specify. 
In other words, cd changes the working directory

3> mkdir: mkdir foldername
This command is used to create folder names in the directory.
The mkdir command stands for "make directory".
It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.

4> touch: 
The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory.
It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.
This command is for creating new files in the folders. We can create files with different extensions.

<!-- overview for the above written commands -->

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.

A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. 
It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.

ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.

cd switches you into the directory you specify.

mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.

touch creates a new file inside the working directory.


<!-- =====================================   -->

5>  ls -a, ls -t, ls -l
The ls command lists all files and directories in the working directory.
The -a modifies the behavior of the ls command to also list the files and directories starting with a dot (.). 
Files started with a dot are hidden, and don't appear when using ls alone.

The -a is called an option. Options modify the behavior of commands.
Here we used ls -a to display the contents of the working directory in more detail.

In addition to -a, the ls command has several more options.
Here are three common options:

-a - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
-l - lists all contents of a directory in long format
-t - order files and directories by the time they were last modified.

6> ls -alt:
The -t option orders files and directories by the time they were last modified.

In addition to using each option separately, like ls -a or ls -l, multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt.

Here, ls -alt lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, 
ordered by the date and time they were last modified.

7> cp from_file_name to_file_name
The cp command copies files or directories. Here, we copy the contents of from_file_name into to_file_name. 

8> multiple files

cp biopic/cleopatra.txt historical/

To copy a file into a directory, use cp with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument.
Here, we copy the file biopic/cleopatra.txt and place it in the historical/ directory.

cp biopic/ray.txt biopic/notorious.txt historical/

To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory 
as the last argument. Here, we copy the files biopic/ray.txt and biopic/notorious.txt into the historical/ directory.

9> using wildcards

cp * satire/
In addition to using filenames as arguments, we can use special characters like * to select groups of files.
These special characters are called wildcards. The * selects all files in the working directory, 
so here we use cp to copy all files into the satire/ directory.

cp m*.txt scifi/
Here, m*.txt selects all files in the working directory starting with "m" and ending with ".txt", and copies them to scifi/.

10> The mv command moves files. It's similar to cp in its usage.

mv superman.txt superhero/
To move a file into a directory, use mv with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument.
Here we move superman.txt into superhero/.

mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
To move multiple files into a directory, use mv with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory
as the last argument. Here, we move wonderwoman.txt and batman.txt into superhero/.

mv batman.txt spiderman.txt
To rename a file, use mv with the old file as the first argument and the new file as the second argument.
By moving batman.txt into spiderman.txt, we rename the file as spiderman.txt.

11> rm
rm waterboy.txt
The rm command deletes files and directories. Here we remove the file waterboy.txt from the filesystem.

rm -r comedy
The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The -r stands for "recursive," and it's used to
delete a directory and all of its child directories.

Be careful when you use rm! It deletes files and directories permanently.
There isn't an undelete command, so once you delete a file or directory with rm, it's gone. 

some more information

rm: rm filename
This command is used to delete the files from the folders or directories.

rm -rf: rm -rf foldername:
This command is to delete the folders from the directory

rm -rf /:
This is the most powerful command. This command is used to delete the whole directory.
Don't run this command.    


<!--     overview second part   -->

Options modify the behavior of commands:

ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified

Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt

From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:

cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories

Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories


<!--  ==================================================   -->

12> echo
$ echo "Hello"
Hello
The echo command accepts the string "Hello" as standard input, and echoes the string "Hello" back to the terminal as standard output.

Let's learn more about standard input, standard output, and standard error:

standard input, abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.
standard output, abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run.
standard error, abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.
Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error to or from a different location.

13> How does redirection work?

$ echo "Hello" > hello.txt
The > command redirects the standard output to a file. Here, "Hello" is entered as the standard input.
The standard output "Hello" is redirected by > to the file hello.txt.

$ cat hello.txt
The cat command outputs the contents of a file to the terminal. When you type cat hello.txt, the contents of hello.txt are displayed.

ex 1: $ cat oceans.txt > continents.txt
> takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right.
Here the standard output of cat oceans.txt is redirected to continents.txt.

Note that > overwrites all original content in continents.txt. When you view the output data by typing cat on continents.txt,
you will see only the contents of oceans.txt.

ex 2: $ cat glaciers.txt >> rivers.txt
>> takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right. 
You can view the output data of the file with cat and the filename.

Here, the the output data of rivers.txt will contain the original contents of rivers.txt with the content of glaciers.txt appended to it.

ex 3: $ cat < lakes.txt
< takes the standard input from the file on the right and inputs it into the program on the left. 
Here, lakes.txt is the standard input for the cat command. The standard output appears in the terminal.

ex 4: $ cat volcanoes.txt | wc
| is a "pipe". The | takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right.
 You can think of this as "command to command" redirection.

Here the output of cat volcanoes.txt is the standard input of wc. in turn, the wc command outputs the number of lines, words, 
and characters in volcanoes.txt, respectively.

$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt
Multiple |s can be chained together. Here the standard output of cat volcanoes.txt is "piped" to the wc command.
 The standard output of wc is then "piped" to cat. Finally, the standard output of cat is redirected to islands.txt.

You can view the output data of this chain by typing cat islands.txt.

ex 5: $ sort lakes.txt
sort takes the standard input and orders it alphabetically for the standard output.
 Here, the lakes in sort lakes.txt are listed in alphabetical order.

$ cat lakes.txt | sort > sorted-lakes.txt
Here, the command takes the standard output from cat lakes.txt and "pipes" it to sort. 
The standard output of sort is redirected to sorted-lakes.txt.

You can view the output data by typing cat on the file sorted-lakes.txt.
 
13> $ uniq deserts.txt
uniq stands for "unique" and filters out adjacent, duplicate lines in a file.
 Here uniq deserts.txt filters out duplicates of "Sahara Desert", because the duplicate of 'Sahara Desert' directly
 follows the previous instance. The "Kalahari Desert" duplicates are not adjacent, and thus remain.

14> sort deserts.txt | uniq
A more effective way to call uniq is to call sort to alphabetize a file, and "pipe" the standard output to uniq. 
Here by piping sort deserts.txt to uniq, all duplicate lines are alphabetized (and thereby made adjacent) and filtered out.

sort deserts.txt | uniq > uniq-deserts.txt
Here we simply send filtered contents to uniq-deserts.txt, which you can view with the cat command. 

15> grep 

$ grep Mount mountains.txt
grep stands for "global regular expression print". It searches files for lines that match a pattern and returns the results.
 It is also case sensitive. Here, grep searches for "Mount" in mountains.txt.

$ grep -i Mount mountains.txt
grep -i enables the command to be case insensitive. Here, grep searches for capital or lowercase strings that match Mount in mountains.txt.

The above commands are a great way to get started with grep. If you are familiar with regular expressions, 
you can use regular expressions to search for patterns in files 

16> grep -R

$ grep -R Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
grep -R searches all files in a directory and outputs filenames and lines containing matched results. 
-R stands for "recursive". Here grep -R searches the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory for the string "Arctic" and 
outputs filenames and lines with matched results.

$ grep -Rl Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
grep -Rl searches all files in a directory and outputs only filenames with matched results.
-R stands for "recursive" and l stands for "files with matches". Here grep -Rl searches the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory 
for the string "Arctic" and outputs filenames with matched results.

17> sed 

$ sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt
sed stands for "stream editor". It accepts standard input and modifies it based on an expression, before displaying it as output data.
 It is similar to "find and replace".

Let's look at the expression 's/snow/rain/':

s: stands for "substitution". it is always used when using sed for substitution.
snow: the search string, the text to find.
rain: the replacement string, the text to add in place.

In this case, sed searches forests.txt for the word "snow" and replaces it with "rain." 
Importantly, the above command will only replace the first instance of "snow" on a line.

$ sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt
The above command uses the g expression, meaning "global". Here sed searches forests.txt for the word "snow" 
and replaces it with "rain", globally. All instances of "snow" on a line will be turned to "rain".  

<!--         overview third     -->

Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error.
The common redirection commands are:

> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.

>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.

< redirects standard input to a command.

| redirects standard output of a command to another command.

A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.

uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.

grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.

sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
