Basic command line commands
===========================

1> ls: This command is used to check the contents of the folder

2> pwd
pwd stands for "print working directory". It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.

2> cd:
cd stands for "change directory". This command is used to change from one directory to another directory.
Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, cd switches you into the directory you specify. 
In other words, cd changes the working directory

3> mkdir: mkdir foldername
This command is used to create folder names in the directory.
The mkdir command stands for "make directory".
It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.

4> touch: 
The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory.
It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.
This command is for creating new files in the folders. We can create files with different extensions.

<!-- overview for the above written commands -->

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.

A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. 
It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.

ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.

cd switches you into the directory you specify.

mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.

touch creates a new file inside the working directory.

6> rm -rf: rm -rf foldername:

7> rm -rf /:
