Basic command line commands
===========================

1> ls: This command is used to check the contents of the folder

2> pwd
pwd stands for "print working directory". It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.

2> cd:
cd stands for "change directory". This command is used to change from one directory to another directory.
Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, cd switches you into the directory you specify. 
In other words, cd changes the working directory

3> mkdir: mkdir foldername
This command is used to create folder names in the directory.
The mkdir command stands for "make directory".
It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.

4> touch: 
The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory.
It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.
This command is for creating new files in the folders. We can create files with different extensions.

<!-- overview for the above written commands -->

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.

A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. 
It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.

ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.

cd switches you into the directory you specify.

mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.

touch creates a new file inside the working directory.


<!-- =====================================   -->

5>  ls -a, ls -t, ls -l
The ls command lists all files and directories in the working directory.
The -a modifies the behavior of the ls command to also list the files and directories starting with a dot (.). 
Files started with a dot are hidden, and don't appear when using ls alone.

The -a is called an option. Options modify the behavior of commands.
Here we used ls -a to display the contents of the working directory in more detail.

In addition to -a, the ls command has several more options.
Here are three common options:

-a - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
-l - lists all contents of a directory in long format
-t - order files and directories by the time they were last modified.

6> ls -alt:
The -t option orders files and directories by the time they were last modified.

In addition to using each option separately, like ls -a or ls -l, multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt.

Here, ls -alt lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, 
ordered by the date and time they were last modified.

7> cp from_file_name to_file_name
The cp command copies files or directories. Here, we copy the contents of from_file_name into to_file_name. 

8> multiple files

cp biopic/cleopatra.txt historical/

To copy a file into a directory, use cp with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument.
Here, we copy the file biopic/cleopatra.txt and place it in the historical/ directory.

cp biopic/ray.txt biopic/notorious.txt historical/

To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory 
as the last argument. Here, we copy the files biopic/ray.txt and biopic/notorious.txt into the historical/ directory.

9> using wildcards

cp * satire/
In addition to using filenames as arguments, we can use special characters like * to select groups of files.
These special characters are called wildcards. The * selects all files in the working directory, 
so here we use cp to copy all files into the satire/ directory.

cp m*.txt scifi/
Here, m*.txt selects all files in the working directory starting with "m" and ending with ".txt", and copies them to scifi/.

10> The mv command moves files. It's similar to cp in its usage.

mv superman.txt superhero/
To move a file into a directory, use mv with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument.
Here we move superman.txt into superhero/.

mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
To move multiple files into a directory, use mv with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory
as the last argument. Here, we move wonderwoman.txt and batman.txt into superhero/.

mv batman.txt spiderman.txt
To rename a file, use mv with the old file as the first argument and the new file as the second argument.
By moving batman.txt into spiderman.txt, we rename the file as spiderman.txt.

11> rm
rm waterboy.txt
The rm command deletes files and directories. Here we remove the file waterboy.txt from the filesystem.

rm -r comedy
The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The -r stands for "recursive," and it's used to
delete a directory and all of its child directories.

Be careful when you use rm! It deletes files and directories permanently.
There isn't an undelete command, so once you delete a file or directory with rm, it's gone. 

<!--     overview second part   -->

Options modify the behavior of commands:

ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified

Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt

From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:

cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories

Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories


<!--  ==================================================   -->

5> rm: rm filename
This command is used to delete the files from the folders or directories.
6> rm -rf: rm -rf foldername:
This command is to delete the folders from the directory
7> rm -rf /:
This is the most powerful command. This command is used to delete the whole directory.
Don't run this command.    


10> man ls/cd/etc
This command is as user guide
